# Calculate heatwave occurrences

## Heatwave definition

Heatwaves are now defined as:

Tmin > 95percentile AND Tmax > 95percentile

For more than 2 consecutive days (i.e. total of 3 or more days).

This replaces the definition of only Tmin > 99percentile for more than 3 consecutive days (total of 4 or more days).

This is what is requested from the Lancet. To be honest it's not clear whether this produces a substantially 'better'
indicator since all heatwave indicators are arbitrary in absence of covariate data (i.e. impact data). Furthermore we
know that the health impacts are mediated by many other things, so in any case we are truely interested just in the
trends i.e. demonstrating that there is a) more heatwaves and b) more exposure to heatwaves - this can be followed by
local studies but (as always) the point is to present a general risk factor trend.

> NOTE: considered just adding the newest year each time instead of re-calculating the whole thing. HOWEVER in
reality, the input data is still changing year to year, so far have needed to re-calculate anyway (e.g. change in
resolution, change from ERAI to ERA5, in the future probably use ERA5-Land, etc). Although it seems like a cool idea
to have a reproducible method where each year you just add one thing, in practice its better to have one 'frozen'
output corresponding to each publication, so that it's easy to go back later to find data corresponding to specific
results. Additionally, generating one file per year means you have a folder full of files that are harder to share,
and the outputs are in the end pretty small (<50MB in Float32)}."""
